<p><strong>License Grant:</strong> Company hereby grants to Customer, subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations set forth in this EULA, a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to use those portions of the Software referred to herein as “Ytel Contact Center,” “message360,” and “Beacon”, and present and future applications, including derivative products and features produced therefrom. The features associated with each of these Software offerings are as described below:</p>

<p><strong>Ytel Contact Center:</strong> is a cloud based contact center software application that enables Customer to accept inbound and make outbound telephone calls. The Ytel Contact Center software has the ability to route inbound calls based on time, destination and source. Outbound calls can be made manually, or in an automated fashion, using the Ytel Contact Center software. The Ytel Contact Center Software enables Customer to generate reports on how many calls are made, both inbound and outbound, together with certain performance metrics of agents using the Ytel Contact Center software.</p>

<p><strong>Ytel API:</strong> is a programming language, combined with a user portal, that enables Customer to design business communication messages. These messages can be communicated via telephone calls, SMS text messages, chats, tweets, e-mail and direct mail. Where Customer is utilizing Ytel API, its employees and agents can: (a) choose a series of options and be routed to internal or external destinations; and/or (b) speak or input DTMF digit tones to identify themselves or pass relevant information to Customer. The IVR system associated with Message360 can be connected to Customer’s systems to further enhance its communications options. Examples include processing inbound calls and routing them to a destination based on customer input or sending pre-recorded telephone messages to many recipients. Message360 also includes applications built on top of it such as Routing, Sippro, and other applications that reside or otherwise use message360(r) engine as its base.</p>

<p><strong>Beacon:</strong> is an integrated marketing application that can broadcast (or communicate) at scale by phone to increase lead conversions and distribute marketing or business notifications in real-time or scheduled. With two simple ways of communicating, ringless voicemail and voice messaging, messages are sent directly to the phones of leads, customers, members, or any target audience you pre-select.
